    Closest relatives?
    dual formulations?
Assumptions and Limitations
    state preconditions and where it fails
Pros & Cons
    list strength and weaknesses

Implementation:
Hierarchy of ABCs
Unit Tests for correctness
Benchmark Tests for performance
    standardized dataset like MNIST

Experimental Analysis:
Performance Validation
