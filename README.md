# Implementations

This repository contains my implementations of fundamental algorithms and data structures across various domains. The goal is to build a solid understanding of core computational techniques through hands-on implementations. Additionally, this repository contains class projects I have done.

## Structure

- Data Structures and Algorithms (C++)
- Systems Programming Projects (C)
- Numerical Methods (Python)
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Algorithms (Python)
- Deep Neural Network Architectures (Python)

## Purpose 

This project serves as a learning resource and a reference for key computational techniques, focusing on clean, well-documented code.

## Contributions

This is a personal project, but suggestions and discussions are welcome!
